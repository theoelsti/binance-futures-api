# Binance Futures Leaderboard API 

##### Welcome to the first Free API documentation for the Binance Public leaderboard API. 

The main use of this [leaderboard ](https://www.binance.com/en/futures-activity/leaderboard/top-ranking) is to check on Binance TOP futures traders, and see their position. 

I decided to start documenting this API since binance don't want to and people are selling it.

Everything is in the  [Wiki ] (https://github.com/theoelsti/binance-futures-api/wiki) !
